View Live https://infinitimeexplorer.netlify.app/

File explorer for InfiniTime external flash, can create and delete directories, delete and upload files.
Also can be used to upload a resource file, the resource file can have directories and files to be uploaded/created on the PineTime.

Tested on Google Chrome, Windows and Android, on the Android some times you need to hit "Reload" to work.
